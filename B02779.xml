            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The PETITION of</hi> George Drummond <hi>Keeper of the Tolbooth of</hi> Edinburgh,</head>
            <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT your Petitioner having a Commiſſion from the Good Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be Keeper of their Tolbooth, with all Fees, Emoluments, and Privileges which had been enjoyed by any formerly in that Office, and free of all Burdens what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, he has been in Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Office, by vertue of his Right, and all the Perquiſits thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>A great part of his Charge being the Receiving and Keeping of Priſoners committed for Crimes, from all places of the Kingdom, Your Petitioner was by neceſſary Conſequence obliged to Maintain and Aliment them, (the Parties themſelves being for the moſt part very poor) and he gave in his Accompts from time to time to the Lords of Treaſury, who before the Year 1688 ordered punctual Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be made both of the Aliment and Houſe-dues of ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, <hi>Excepting</hi> what was due for thoſe who were ſet at Liberty, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the General Indemnity juſt Publiſh'd before the Revolution, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to above four Hundred lib. <hi>Sterl:</hi> of which, he expected to be re-imburſed by the Government, and what he ſtill hopes will be taken into Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner has, ſince the Revolution, continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> in the ſame Office, and till within theſe 7 Years or thereby, has received ſeveral Precepts for the ſaid Houſe-dues, and Aliment jointly to Accompt, from the Lords of Treaſury, and upon the Faith thereof, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to advance the Aliment of Criminal Priſoners as formerly; But finding that theſe conſtant Out-givings did far exhauſt all his other Profits, Your Petitioner was not able to ſupport ſo great a Burden, which gave Occaſion to Her Majeſty's Advocate, to repreſent that Matter to the Lords of Privy Council, who were pleaſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, That the Magiſtrats of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſhould pay the Houſe-dues of Priſoners Incarcerate for Murder, Theft, and ſuch Crimes, But that both their Aliment and the Houſe-dues of Priſoners on account, and by order of the Government, ſhould be defrayed by the Publick, and recommended Your Petitioner to the Lords of Treaſury for that Effect, as the Act it ſelf dated 3 of <hi>October</hi> 1704 Years at more length bears: But upon a Repreſentation given in by the Good Town, <hi>Signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:174914:2"/>That the Government had been in conſtant Uſe to make Payment of both theſe Charges, and that they are ſo to continue by the late Act of Security, <hi>as alſo,</hi> That Sheriffs at Clearing of their Equies are in uſe to get large Allowance on the account of Publick Priſoners, which demonſtrates, That theſe are a Charge on the Government; there was a ſtop put to the Sentence, to your Petitioner's great Loſs and Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>There being no further Procedure in this Buſineſs ſince that time, and it being of very Great Moment to your Petitioner, to have ſome Certainty to depend on, he is neceſſitate with all Humility, to lay his Caſe before Your Grace and the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parliament, and begs leave to repreſent,</p>
            <p>That his Charge, being a very great Truſt, obliges him to find Caution for a greater Value than any other Office in the Kingdom; That it binds him to conſtant Attendance, and to keep many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for whom he is anſwerable; That beſides, your Petitioner and his Cautioners are obnoxious to the conſtant Hazard of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape of Priſoners and otherwiſe, and did actually ſuſtain the Loſs of near 300 lib. <hi>Sterling</hi> by the breaking up the Tolbooth ſummarly, without any Warrant from the Government, about five Years ago.</p>
            <p>All this being conſidered, your Petitioner is firmly perſwaded, That the Fees and Emoluments, belonging to his Office, (of which the Aliment and Houſe-dues of Criminal Priſoners make a great part) will be thought but a ſuitable Recompenſe for his Trouble &amp; Charge, eſpecially ſeeing his Claim is expreſly founded on his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Right.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner has an entire Confidence, that the Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Goodneſs of Your Grace and the High Court of Parliament, will fall on ſome effectual Means, to refound your Petitioner of theſe Sums, a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

And that at preſent there are ſeveral Criminals in Priſon, to be brought to Tryal, who are at the Point of Starving, unleſs ſome ſpeedy Remedy be applyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe Your Grace &amp; the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parliament, to determine, who ſhall be lyable in Payment of the foreſaid Houſe-dues and Aliment of Criminal Priſoners, and to lay down ſome effectual Rule, by which not only the Bygones may be paid up, but Your Petitioner have ſome Certainty to depend on for Payment of the ſame in time coming.</hi> And your Petitioner ſhall ever Pray, &amp;c.</p>
